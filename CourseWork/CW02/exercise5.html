Watch us go 'round and 'round each time </p>  
<p class= "chorus">Chorus: You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

"Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?" Ay  </p>  
<p class= "chorus">Chorus: So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game </p>
