alt="school image" width=200 height=200 border=0 align = "right"></a>

<p>This paragraph is for the file labeled image. The image used was an image
of school supplies used in public schools. This is part of the last activity
in my first assignment for web programming. The link that I decided to use to 
use for the image is a link to the index file that has all of the other activities
that are part of the assignment. There were a total of five activities in this 
assignment.It is an activity that gave me some valuable practice that
hopefully will help me with the other assignments I will have. I decided to make the
image bigger in order for the image to be seen </p>
